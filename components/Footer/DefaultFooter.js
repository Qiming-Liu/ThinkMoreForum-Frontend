              Etsy is a global online marketplace, where people come together to
              make, sell, buy and collect unique items. We’re also a community
              pushing for positive change for small businesses, people, and the
              planet.

            <Typography>
              There’s no Etsy warehouse – just millions of people selling the
              things they love. We make the whole process easy, helping you
              connect directly with makers to find something extraordinary.
