      'No Time To Die review: Thrilling but inconsistent emotional end to Daniel Craig’s Bond journey',
    context:
      "<h2>A send-off soaring as loud as the enigmatic gunshot sound that comes at the end of the iconic gun barrel sequence, opening every cannon Bond film in existence.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>With Daniel Craig and most the cast from the previous movie returning for their designated roleplay, there are few new characters thrown into the already star-studded mix, namely Rami Malek's Safin and his french sidekick, a child actor and a couple of men&nbsp;from Blofeld's ever growing list of&nbsp;henchmen. No Time to Die is a through and through tribute to Craig's tenure as Bond and to the fans of the 21st century version of the franchise who have stuck along since the first installment landed back in the theatres of 2006,</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The movie picks up exactly where it left off at the end of Spectar, with Swan and Bond car-riding their way off into a possibly 'happy ever after'&nbsp;this period of blissfullness and mental tranquility is short lived when they are attacked by a group of hired goons and the plot picks its pace hereafter, whatever&nbsp;transpires next is your jobs to find out, even though there is a reasonable explanation as who to the antagonist Safin is and why he's chosen to bring doomsday upon the world as his pen-ultimate goal of life, you will need binge watch CR and Spectar (at-least) to get a grasp onto the sentimenal depths of James Bond, otherwise it won't generate the level of emotional connectivity one must essentially feel twords a main protagonist, by no means am I trying to convey that it cannot be watched as a stanalone, all I'm saying is that, for you have a most efficient run for the money you spend buying your tickets, you should consider investing 5 hrs of your daytimes into watching these 2 gigs mentioned above before picking up the finale(they are available to rent on YT n Netflix or download through Torrent) trust me they will be worth the time.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>NTTD makes uttmost use of the very strength that set Daniel's Bond apart from its predecessing machismo potrayals by Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnon, it tells that an overly attractive face with a ripped body structure doesn't always have to be the only positive characteristic audience's are compelled to like about a character as historic as Bond. Craig's Bond in eyes of public is a man with outermost layer tough concreat and unremorsefull as a piece of rock, yet during those miniscule of moments when the spotlight is away from, that is when the facad falls,stripped bare(literally as well as figuratively) what you actually see is man who even though kills human beings as if they are ants and treats women like commodities of pleseure, is tired of it all, he wants a normal life much like everyone else, but the pattern under which his life has structured itself from an early age doesn't let him have at it , he's wants to run away from all the gun blazing, car chasing, having to live under the tagline of 'kill or be killed' but cannot because betrayal, tradey, adrenalin-rush and being used like a merciless machine is all he identifies himself to, off course a weaponery equipped Aston Martin DB5 and an airjet cum submarine only enhance fun of the party. NTTD excels in a field I have rarely seen any Bond film set record at, I'm talking about the cinematography, starting from lush view of tropical forests to frozen suburb of Norway, beautiful beachs and an sparsely popular historic location, the camera directory is top notch, when mingled with the ever improving&nbsp;hand to hand combat sequence, car chases,&nbsp;rooftop driving, NTTD makes one hell of feast for everyones eyes, this being the only JB movie released in 3d yet, I implore you check the format out, it's breathtaking.</h2>",

Last summer, we formed the React 18 Working Group to gather feedback from experts in the community and ensure a smooth upgrade experience for the entire React ecosystem.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>In case you missed it, we shared a lot of this vision at React Conf 2021:</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>1.

        '<h2>Weird West brings the hybrid genre of fantasy and horror Western to PC and consoles through the lens of an immersive sim filled with choices and possibilities.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>It’s not every day that we receive an immersive sim, let alone one made by veteran developers from games such as Dishonored or Prey, but that’s exactly what WolfEye Studios’ has delivered with Weird West, a bold incursion into a setting which hasn’t received nearly as much attention as it deserves — think of the classic Western tropes and ambience mixed with fantasy and horror elements. It’s a (mostly literary and cinematic) blend that hasn’t been explored much in video games, although recent titles such as Hard West or West of Dead made a significant push for the genre.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Of couse, the main selling point here is that Weird West comes from the makers of Dishonored, the 2012 hit video game that masterfully combined first-person action with non-linear levels and the high levels of interaction of immersive sims. I can happily confirm the ex-Arkane devs have successfully transferred much of that DNA into a game that has its own voice and mannerisms.</h2>',
